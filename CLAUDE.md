# PPI — rules for Claude Code

Read `docs/PRD.md` (what to build) and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (how it fits together) first.
Setup steps for humans are in `SETUP.md`.

## Hard rules

- **Never** put the Supabase service role / secret key in the web app, `.env*`, Vercel or the repo.
  Anything that needs it (stock pull, Stripe, inviting owners) is a Supabase Edge Function.
- Public pages (home, shop, item) load data in **server components** via `@/lib/supabase/server`.
  Never fetch public data in the browser: crawlers and AI assistants read only the first HTML.
- Freshness, availability labels and quantity hiding live **in the database**
  (`freshness_label`, `availability_label`, `public_stock`, `search_stock`). Never recompute them in React.
  Visitors read stock only through `public_stock` / `search_stock`, never `inventory`.
- Every database change is a new file in `supabase/migrations/` (never edit an applied one).
  Add a check to `supabase/tests/database_test.sql` for every rule you add.
- **Europe-wide, no home town.** Never hard-code a city, country, currency or time zone.
  **No location services**: the website never asks for or guesses the visitor's location (no device location,
  no IP lookup). Search is text only — item name (original or its sk/hu/en translation), brand, EAN, shop name, street
  or town — across all shops; every word must match (`matches_all_words`, `item_names_text` + trigram index).
- Show the item name as the shop wrote it, plus `translatedName()` (`@/lib/names`) in the page language under it.
- Times stored in UTC, shown in the **shop's** time zone (`shops.timezone`) via `@/lib/format`.
  Prices via `formatPrice(value, locale, currency)` with the item's own currency.
- All visible text comes from `src/i18n/messages/{sk,hu,en}.json`; add every new key to all three.

## Design

Plain white background, black text, thin light-grey lines (`border-line`, `text-muted`).
**No colours** (only exceptions, at the owner's request: the Cacadoo PPI logo in the header, `public/brand/cacadoo-ppi.png`,
and the blue "Select picture" link for shop logos), no dark mode, no cart icons. Availability is always written out as text, emphasised in bold.
Mobile-first. Map: `@/components/ShopMap` (MapLibre + OpenFreeMap "positron", no API key), black dot pins;
always an extra — every page must work and show its data without it.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — local site on http://localhost:3000
- `npm run lint` · `npm run typecheck` · `npm run build`
- `npm run test:db` — applies all migrations + seed to a throwaway local Postgres/PostGIS and runs the RLS and stock-logic checks
- `npm run check:functions` — type-checks the Supabase Edge Functions (Deno) in `supabase/functions/`
- `npm run test:functions` — unit tests of the Edge Functions (Deno): stock-pull file reading and mapping, Stripe
  checkout and webhook

## AI access

`src/lib/publicApi.ts` is the single source for the public API (`/api/v1/*`, OpenAPI at `/api/openapi.json`)
and the MCP server (`/mcp`, stateless Streamable HTTP, tools `search_stock`, `get_shop`, `get_item`):
anon client without cookies (`@/lib/supabase/public`), every result carries `source_url`, the database
decides availability/quantity. Every API/MCP request goes through `rateLimit` (`api_hit`: 60/min, daily-salted
IP hash). Items carry `name`, `name_translated` (in `lang`) and `name_lang`. `robots.ts`, `sitemap.ts` and
`llms.txt` live at the app root.

## AI search

Main page only, on request ("Search with AI" → `?ai=1`), as an extra layer above the server-rendered plain results:
`@/components/AiSearch` → `POST /api/ai-search` → `@/lib/aiSearch` (Claude Haiku, one strict tool `search_stock` from
`publicApi.ts`, no location, structured final answer; cards only from the tool results). `ai_search_hit()`: 10 per
minute per caller, `AI_DAILY_LIMIT` per day. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is a server env variable (never `NEXT_PUBLIC`); without
it, over a limit or on any error the layer disappears silently for shoppers; a logged-in owner sees the reason instead
(`search.ai_unavailable`), and every reason is logged as `ai-search: …` (Vercel logs).

## Paid plan (Stripe)

One monthly subscription per shop; test mode first. `public.subscriptions` (one row per shop, owners read their own) is
written only by the service role: `supabase/functions/stripe-checkout` (owner's JWT → `is_shop_member`; makes the shop's
Stripe customer once → `link_stripe_customer()`; returns the Checkout URL, or the customer-portal URL when the shop's
subscription is live) and `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook` (verifies the Stripe signature, fetches the subscription
fresh, `apply_stripe_subscription()`). **Every paid feature checks only `shop_has_plan(shop)`** (active or trialing and
not past `current_period_end`); never decide it in React. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
`STRIPE_PRICE_PRO` are function secrets; the website has no Stripe key and reaches Stripe only through the dashboard
server action `openBilling` → stripe-checkout. Checkout: automatic tax, business name (required), VAT number (tax ID
collection), company ID (custom field, pre-filled from `shops.ico`, copied to the customer's invoices). A shop whose
plan still renews cannot be deleted (`owner_delete_shop`).

## Shop assistant (paid)

Shop page only, only when `shop_has_plan(shop)` is true and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set: `@/components/ShopChat`
(collapsed box; the page stays server-rendered without it) → `POST /api/shops/[slug]/chat` → `@/lib/shopChat` (Claude
`AI_MODEL`, default Haiku `claude-haiku-5-5`; strict tools bound to that shop on the server: `search_items` →
`shop_stock`, `get_item` → `public_stock` filtered by the shop, and `search_shop_docs` when the shop has documents;
never other shops; structured answer: answer, item_refs, shopping_list, photo read/match, sources, pictures,
document_prices, call_shop). Cards, the list, sources and pictures only from tool results; a document price only if
the excerpt contains it; availability from the database. Every message passes
`shop_chat_hit()` (plan, 20/hour per caller in `api_usage`, `CHAT_MONTHLY_LIMIT_PER_SHOP` per shop and month in
`shop_chat_usage`). Photos: shrunk in the browser (≤1568 px JPEG), sent once, never stored or logged; "found" without
an item becomes "unsure". History: last 8 messages, text only.

## Documents for the assistant (paid)

Owners upload PDFs and pictures (dashboard `ShopDocuments` → `@/components/DocUpload`): **never products** (items,
prices, stock only from the stock file) and **never edited or translated** by PPI (text as written; the only thing the
owner corrects is the AI's picture description, `description_by_owner`). PDFs are read **in the owner's browser**
(`@/lib/pdfRead`, pdf.js legacy build, assets from `scripts/copy-pdfjs-assets.mjs`) because Edge Functions have 2 s
CPU; `supabase/functions/doc-ingest` (owner's JWT, actions register_document / document_uploaded / text /
register_pictures / pictures_uploaded / document_done / work / links / delete) stores excerpts (`chunkPages`, one page
apart, ≤ ~800 words, `detectLang`) and lets Claude (`AI_MODEL`) describe pictures and write out scanned pages. Limits:
`SHOP_DOCS_MAX_FILES`/`_PAGES`/`_PICTURES` (Supabase secrets). Private bucket `shop-docs` (owners only insert
registered files; service role reads/deletes). Visibility is decided only in SQL: `search_shop_docs(slug, q, token)`
(Public folder + folders of a valid session; never accepts folder ids), `shop_file_path()` for `shop-files` (10-minute
signed URLs). Access keys: `owner_create_folder_key()` (shown once, SHA-256 only), `unlock_shop_folders()` (5 wrong per
caller/shop/15 min) → session token in a signed HttpOnly cookie per shop (`@/lib/docsAccess`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECRET`,
path `/api/shops/<slug>/`, routes `access` and `files`); the key and token never reach the AI. Private content never in
pages, JSON-LD, sitemap, llms.txt, public API, MCP or the main-page AI search.

## Stock upload

`supabase/functions/stock-pull/index.ts` (single file, paste-deployable) only receives uploads:
`POST ?shop_id=&file_time=&file_name=[&gzip=1]` with the owner's (or legacy admin's) JWT, checked by `upload_check_in()`.
It downloads nothing and runs on no schedule (cloud links and the cron pull were removed on 2026-10-08, migration 16).
A file not newer than `latest_file_time` is skipped; XML/CSV(UTF-8 or Windows-1250)/XLSX → rows; mapping proposals
(Claude with structured outputs, else `guessMapping`) are never auto-approved; `apply_stock_file()` writes a full file
in one transaction (missing items → quantity 0). >5 % unreadable rows → keep old stock, propose a new mapping.
After an `updated` file, in the background (`EdgeRuntime.waitUntil`): `items_to_translate()` → Claude Haiku in batches
of 200 (structured output: lang, sk, hu, en) → `apply_item_translations()`; never touches stock, never overwrites the
owner's correction (`owner_set_item_translation()`, `name_i18n_by_owner`); failures are retried with the next file.

## Shop PC

No software on the shop PC except the PPI web app (`app/manifest.ts`, installable, starts at `/sync`). `/[lang]/sync`
→ `@/components/FolderSync` (File System Access API, Edge/Chrome only; Firefox/Safari get a message): folder handle in
IndexedDB (`@/lib/folderStore`), check every 15 min, one window per shop (Web Locks), `upload_check_in()` then POST the
newest finished file (untouched 60 s) to `stock-pull?shop_id=…` with the owner's JWT. Also "Upload file" (one file by
hand, any browser, same POST). Guide: `docs/SHOP_PC_SETUP.md`.

## Auth

Self-service, shop owners only — **no admin area on the website**. E-mail + password: `/signup` (anyone; Supabase
sends a confirmation e-mail), `/login`, `/forgot` (reset e-mail → `/auth/confirm` → `/[lang]/password`). `/auth/confirm`
handles `token_hash` (templates in SETUP.md E3), `code` (default templates) and `#access_token` (→ `/[lang]/login/finish`).
Owners create/edit shops via `owner_save_shop()`, read them via `my_shops()`, approve columns via `owner_set_mapping()`,
delete via `owner_delete_shop()`. Every server action re-checks the session via `@/lib/auth`; RLS and those functions
are the real boundary. Anything needing the service role key goes in `supabase/functions/`.
